VIM + TMUX Config
=================

My config files for VIM and TMUX. Just pull this repo in your home, and
everything should work fine.

If you use VIM in your terminal (I use it in iTerm2), this config assumes 
that you've installed Solarized, for your terminal emulator. For iTerm2, it's
distributed [here](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized).

My ideal setup these days: iTerm2+TMUX, full-screen, with Solarized color scheme.
I then use VIM within TMUX. The cool thing about that setup is that whether you work
on a server or locally, you don't even see the difference.

One last detail, you need to use a patched font to get VIM's power bar to render properly.
I'm providing a patched Monaco in .tmux/.

Enjoy!
